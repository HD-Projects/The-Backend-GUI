# Email Backend GUI

This is a project by 2 7th graders in the **VRC competive robotics program**, beacuse our season was ended abruptly because of COVID-19 we wanted a project to work on so we made a game and started work on a email client

# Overview

* We have been working on a game like asteroids the GitHub page is [Here](https://github.com/The-Bit-One/Asteroid_Dodge). This will be the email backend we use to send all the emails for our games mailing list.
* We strted this because we have tried mailchimp and it sent all of the emails to our junk box
